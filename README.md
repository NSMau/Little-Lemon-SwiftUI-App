# Little-Lemon-SwiftUI-App

This repo holds the code used to create the Little Lemon app for the [Create the User Interface with SwiftUI
](https://www.coursera.org/learn/create-the-user-interface-with-swiftui?specialization=meta-ios-developer) course (from the [Meta iOS Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-ios-developer) program). The app is written in SwiftUI.
